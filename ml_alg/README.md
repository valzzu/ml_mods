# Notes
* [IKTweaks](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods) support is removed due to several issues after release tag [`r51`](https://github.com/SDraw/ml_mods/tree/r51).
* You can't be picked up in worlds that don't allow risky functions.
* Self pulling is possible with limitations:
  * You can't move yourself as others do
  * You can't pull your head because of weird VRChat's behaviour
* Shame on you for using it in ERP.
